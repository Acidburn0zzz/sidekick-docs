# What's New in Sidekick 0.2.3

> To run NativeScript Sidekick, you need to have NativeScript CLI version 3.2.0 or later installed on your machine. 

* **Code Signing Assistance**<br/> If you have a **Free Apple Developer account**, you can use this functionality to create temporary certificates and  mobile provisions which can be used to deploy and test your app on a device.

* **Create a Certificate Signing Request**<br/> You can now create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in Sidekick. The CSR is a prerequisite for creating a certificate in the iOS Dev Center.

* **Updated App Settings**<br/> You can now set the Minimum and Target SDK versions from the Android tab of App Settings. 

* **Notable Resolved Issues**
	* When you debug apps deployed on an iOS device, the expressions in the Watch panel are not respected.
