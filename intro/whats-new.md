# What's New in Sidekick 0.2.2

* **Notable Resolved Issues**
	* When using Node.js 8.x.x, Sidekick does not detect the correct version of the NativeScript CLI installed on your machine. 
	* You cannot build the Angular Master Detail template for Android in the cloud. The process cannot complete and the follow error message appears: `ab.buildDeploy.shell.build - SASS compiler failed with exit code 1`.
