# What's New in Sidekick 1.1.0

> To run {{ site.ns-sk }}, you need to have {{ site.ns-cli }} version **3.4.0** or later installed on your machine. 

* **Modify Your Proxy Settings**<br/>
On Windows systems, you can configure the proxy settings of Sidekick and the {{ site.ns-cli }} directly from the client. For more information, see [Configure Proxy Settings]({% slug proxy %}). 

* **Initial Environment Verification**<br/> 
When you launch the {{ site.ns-sk }} client, it will check if you have Node.js and {{ site.ns-cli }} installed on your machine. If any of those dependencies are missing, {{ site.sk }} will offer to download and install them automatically. This verification is available only when you run {{ site.sk }} on Windows and macOS systems.
