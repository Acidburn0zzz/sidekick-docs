# Debugging Your App

Debug an app deployed on a connected device, Android emulator, or the iOS simulator. You can access this functionality from the **DEVICES** tab in the bottom right corner of the client. If you have a debuggable app running on the device, you will see the **Start Debugger** button next to the device name.
