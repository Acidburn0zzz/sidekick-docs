# Plugins Management

From the **Plugins** tab, you can find, install, update, configure and delete various {{ site.ns }} plugins. 

The **Installed** section shows a list of all plugins that are already included in your app. From here, you can update or delete any previously installed plugin.

The **Available** section lets you search the npm registry for {{ site.ns }} plugins and include them to your app just by clicking the install button.
