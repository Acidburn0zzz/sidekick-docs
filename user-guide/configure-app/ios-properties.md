# iOS Settings

In the **iOS Settings** tab, you can set, enable and modify iOS specific properties.

* **Application Version**<br />
* **Application Build Version**<br />
* **Deployment Target**<br /> The deployment target determines the minimum iOS version on which your app can run on device.
* **Device Families**<br /> The device family determines on which iOS devices users can run your app. For example: if only iPad is enabled, your app will not launch on iPhone.
* **Background Modes**<br /> The background mode determines whether your app needs to use an iOS service while in the background to work properly. Select only required services. For example: for a media player, enable Audio.
* **Supported Interface Orientations**<br /> The supported interface orientation toggles the availability of these modes on the devices running your app. For example: if only portrait is enabled, your app will never go into landscape view on the device.
