# General Settings

In the **General Settings** tab, you can set or modify the app name, description, application identifier, application version, and author. 

* **App Name**<br /> The app name is the user-friendly title that appears on the device below the app icon. This setting applies to all device platforms. To set different display names for each platform, you need to modify the respective configuration files.
* **App Folder**<br /> The app folder field shows the storage location of your app.
* **Description**<br /> The description of the app.
* **Application Identifier**<br /> The application identifier (App ID) is the unique identifier for your applications. To be able to build for both Android and iOS, your App ID must be unique and contain two or more strings, separated by a dot. Each string must start with a letter and should contain only letters and numbers. The app identifier must not start with an uppercase letter.
* **Application Version**<br /> The application version is used to create a uniform version for both iOS and Android. Originally, when you have just created the app, this field is grayed out. To enable it, you should open the **Android** tab in **App Settings**, set the **Application Version Code** to `10000` and then click **Save**. This action is required due to the nature of the version code and how it is calculated based on the Android Application Version.
* **Author**<br /> The name of the application author.
