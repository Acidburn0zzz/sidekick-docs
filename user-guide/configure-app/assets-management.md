# Assets Management

In the **Assets** tab, you can see the icons and splash screens that are currently associated with your app. 

> The functionality of this tab will be extended in one of our future releases. We plan to introduce the option to automatically generate assets (splash screens and icons) for all mobile platforms based on a single image.
