# Create from Template

To help you get started with mobile app development, {{ site.ns-sk }} provides a selection of templates from which you can create an app. Based on the project type (JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular & TypeScript), you can choose between the Blank, Drawer Navigation, Tab Navigation and Master Detail templates.

We recommend the Master Detail template, as it uses Firebase to manage app content and offers the most complete and enriched experience.

## Procedure

1. Launch {{ site.ns-sk }}.
1. Click **Create**.
1. In the **App Name** text box, type a name for your app.
1. In **Project Folder**, click **Browse** to set a storage location for your app.
1. In the **App ID** text box, {{ site.sk }} has automatically generated an App ID (the unique application identifier of your app) in the format `org.nativescript.<App Name>`.
1. (Optional) To enter your own App ID, disable the **Automatically set App ID** check box. In the text box below, type an App ID for your app. For more information about the App ID and how it should be structured, see [Application Identifier in General Settings]({% slug general-properties %}).
1. Select a **Project Type**.
1. Select one of the available templates.
1. In the bottom right corner, click **Create App**.
